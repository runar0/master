General TODO:

- Results:
  - Model sensitivity: Se Jahres kommentar

- Sammendrag: 
  - Translate abstract!

- Proof-read (as in; might need reformulations and rewriting):
   Framework
   Abstract
   Discussion

General:
   - Ofc we need to do a complete read-through by the end, spotting typos and miss corrected words.
   - Avoid full page illustrations, as this breaks the flow of the text. For results this is less important.
   - Re-read Jahres comments, make sure we have addressed obvious weaknesses.
   - Read Toni's comments once we get them
   - All Sniper code should be committed, commented and made obvious. Compress it for delivery, it will be handed in alongside the pdf.
   - Read the table of algorithms/tables/figures, add short descriptions to any element with really long captions

Roadmap:
- Onsdag 3, Torsdag 4:  Algorithms
- Fredag 5: Proof-read all required sections, translate abstract to norwegian, complete any other missing tasks
- Lørdag 6: Print hele thesis, les igjennom, fiks eventuelle skrivefeil, skjekk innleveringsprosedyrer og se at vi er heilt klare.
- Mandag-Tirsdag: Prepare a code tarball, commit it to this repo. Fiks alle tasks fra lørdagens gjennomlesning. Lever innen tirdagskveld, for aller siste møte på onsdag.


Thursdag: 
  - Algorithms introduction, make sure footnote is either on the page with the table or after? Also the three policies should not be split over two pages!
  - Read through framework, change references to shadow tags to ATDs!

  - Proof-read results
  - NUCache - Needs either an architectural overview, or we simplify the explanation leaving out some details of the NUTrack and deliIP selection
