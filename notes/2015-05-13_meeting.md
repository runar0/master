Tasks:

- Figure 1.2: Latex layout is bad, needs a margin between the two sub figures
- Figure 2.4: Time axis is hidden behind background
- Figure 2.5: Wrong color (fixed, needs to be redownloaded and committed)
- Figure 2.6: Reduce size, fix layout relative to previous figure
- Tabel: Create table of algorithms!
- Figure 2.8: Convert to figure using LRU template
- UCP: Create figure, LRU template. Start with two cores and a 1-3 pyhsical division 2-2 allocations, do two inserts and end at 2-2
- PIPP: Do the same example as in UCP but with PIPP insertion rules?
- LRU section: Add paragraph about the stack property, as this is assumed known in multiple other algorithms!
- CLU: Create a dummy plot showing a LRU and BIP utility graph, write a short paragraph detailing how the algorithm selects between LRU and BIP given two sample allocations.
