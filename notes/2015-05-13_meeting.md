Split deadlines:
 - 27. May Wednesday: Complete framework (Text and diagrams)

General TODO:

- Algorithms:
  - Add missing figures, all up to UCP is good
     - Before creating more figures we should plan a access pattern that can be used in all cases, and will show all behaviour
        This makes it easier to follow, and it makes it easier to see differences between algorithms
     - The split between algorithms will make it so that one needs a stream with multiple cores while the other does not care, this makes the grouping logical
     - Make the figures more compact

    - We should create ONE common access pattern for each group, and have all figures use that pattern, this will make it easier to follow.

- Framework.
  - Proof-read

- Results:
  - Model sensitivity: Se Jahres kommentar


- Abstract!

- Discussion

General:
   - Ofc we need to do a complete read-through by the end, spotting typos and miss corrected words.
   - Avoid full page illustrations, as this breaks the flow of the text. For results this is less important.
   - Re-read Jahres comments, make sure we have addressed obvious weaknesses.
   - Read Toni's comments once we get them
   - All Sniper core should be committed, commented and made obvious. Compress it for delivery, it will be handed in alongside the pdf.


Leave for later:
- UCP: Create figure, LRU template. Start with two cores and a 1-3 pyhsical division 2-2 allocations, do two inserts and end at 2-2
- PIPP: Do the same example as in UCP but with PIPP insertion rules?
- CLU: Create a dummy plot showing a LRU and BIP utility graph, write a short paragraph detailing how the algorithm selects between LRU and BIP given two sample allocations.


- Tirsdag 2: Discussion, fullfør to seksjoner - referanser til framework. Begyn på algorithms
- Onsdag 3, Torsdag 4:  Algorithms
- Fredag 5: Abstract, sammendrag, + avslutter alle tasks her
- Mandag 8: Print hele thesis, les igjennom, fiks eventuelle skrive feil, skjekk innleveringsprosedyrer og se at vi er heilt klare. Lever til Jahre?
