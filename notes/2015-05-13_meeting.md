Prioritized tasks:


Sunday:

- Tabel: Create table of algorithms!
- LRU section: Add paragraph about the stack property, as this is assumed known in multiple other algorithms!
- Result: Force figures to stay within their section
- Implementation PIPP: Mention the modified pipp algorithm, reference the related work DRRIP?

- Figure 1.2: Latex layout is bad, needs a margin between the two sub figures
- Figure 2.4: Time axis is hidden behind background
- Figure 2.5: Wrong color (fixed, needs to be redownloaded and committed)
- Figure 2.6: Reduce size, fix layout relative to previous figure
- Figure 5.4 f, g. PIPP data out of bounds (L2 variation STP results, decrease Y-axis lower limit)
- figure 5.3c: 4-avg: increase both lower and upper limit, lower can be set to 0.8, upper must accomodate mpki
- Make sure all figure, table and algorithm captions end with a dot.
- Add todos/add text to:
	- Discussion
	- Conclusion
	- Future work

- Plot average speedup vs publication date
- Figure 2.8: Convert to figure using LRU template
- UCP: Create figure, LRU template. Start with two cores and a 1-3 pyhsical division 2-2 allocations, do two inserts and end at 2-2
- PIPP: Do the same example as in UCP but with PIPP insertion rules?
- CLU: Create a dummy plot showing a LRU and BIP utility graph, write a short paragraph detailing how the algorithm selects between LRU and BIP given two sample allocations.

Leave for later:

- Comment and clean code, make sure everything is merged correctly to development branch, preparing for handin
