Split deadlines:
 - 27. May Wednesday: Complete framework (Text and diagrams)

 - TBD: Discussion and conclusion completed, this is mostly todos and updates to figures.
 - TBD: Abstract, and a final evaluation and proof read.
 (Split) (HAS TO BE DONE BY 31. May, leaving one week to algorithms and last minute tweaks) Entire thesis is good to go, only tweaks to algorithms is missing.
 - Final changes to main result section
 - TBD: Algorithms, this is a big one


General TODO:

- Algorithms:
  - Add missing figures, all up to UCP is good
     - Before creating more figures we should plan a access pattern that can be used in all cases, and will show all behaviour
        This makes it easier to follow, and it makes it easier to see differences between algorithms
     - The split between algorithms will make it so that one needs a stream with multiple cores while the other does not care, this makes the grouping logical
     - Make the figures more compact

- Implementation -> Framework.
  - Move selection of Sniper to framework
    - (Update comparison of SimFlex and SimPoint, make it more explicit, should only need one or two sentences)
  - Document sniper structure
  - Document our changes in Sniper
    - Create a block diagram showing the relationships between a core, cache_ctrl, cache, cache set info and finally cache set.
    - (In potentially a second graph) show the  inheritence three from cache_set and cache_set_info into our implemented algorithms.
  - Document implemented algorithms

- Methodology:
  - Make SimFlex vs SimPoint more clear
  - Proof-read
  - See if it makes sense plotting all  benchmarks on a 2d plane

- Results:
  - Model sensitivity: Se Jahres kommentar

- Conclusion:
 	- Plot HMS and STP in final graph, do lines and not points.

- Abstract!

- Discussion

General:
   - Ofc we need to do a complete read-through by the end, spotting typos and miss corrected words.
   - Avoid full page illustrations, as this breaks the flow of the text. For results this is less important.
   - Re-read Jahres comments, make sure we have addressed obvious weaknesses.
   - Read Toni's comments once we get them
   - All Sniper core should be committed, commented and made obvious. Compress it for delivery, it will be handed in alongside the pdf.
   - Add title page? 


Specific, and prioritized, task:


Leave for later:
- UCP: Create figure, LRU template. Start with two cores and a 1-3 pyhsical division 2-2 allocations, do two inserts and end at 2-2
- PIPP: Do the same example as in UCP but with PIPP insertion rules?
- CLU: Create a dummy plot showing a LRU and BIP utility graph, write a short paragraph detailing how the algorithm selects between LRU and BIP given two sample allocations.

- Fill out discussion, conclusion and future work 
- Comment and clean code, make sure everything is merged correctly to development branch, preparing for handin
