General TODO:


 - Add 8-core and possibly 16-core data to the conclusion figure
 - Make sure we reflect that PIPP is good for 4-core random workloads

 - Add a list of abbrevations, there is a package for that

 - Prettify the algorithms table

 - Read result chapter, does it still make sense?
 - Read abstract and Sammendrag
