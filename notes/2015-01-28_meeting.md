Meeting (2015-01-28)
===================

- Processor model:
    - Single L3 is OK. We should discuss the other option and refer to the new i7 and Xeon. Our reason to select a single cache file is in part driven by the fact that the algorithms we explore are aimed toward this architecture.
    - Do a sensitivity analysis of important model parameters, such as ROB, load/store queue and MSHRs)
    - We will want to vary both L2 and L3 cache size. Also, we should vary cache access latency when we change the size. Use CACTI to estimate latencies for L2 128kB-1024kB and L3 4-32MB. Make sure to use high-performance storage cells.
    - Document why we are using HP cells over the other alternatives.
    - Investigate how the SNIPER dram model works. Do they actually simulate bank conflicts, row access, etc. or is it just constant access times?


- Start filling in the background section, better do it now than get stuck with it later.

- Replacement algorithms: Implement DR-RIP
