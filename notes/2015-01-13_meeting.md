TODO:
- Select algorithms to focus on
- Reclassify benchmarks, generate new workloads, document
- Start by implementing static way partitioning to test the setup
   - UCP can be implemented easily given this in place
- Begin report, figure out how best to orginaize things, there must be some resources available (Consult compenium)
- Sketch information about the selected algorthms while reading/implementing
- All experiments by february/mid march?


Next
