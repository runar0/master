\section*{Problem Description}
Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs) or multi-core architectures are becoming increasingly popular, both in industry and academia. 
CMPs often share on-chip cache space between cores. 
When the CMP is used to run multiprogrammed workloads, different processes compete for cache space. 
Severe competition can lead to considerable performance degradation. 

In recent years, a large number of shared cache management schemes have been proposed to alleviate this problem.
The main aim of this project is shed some light on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different cache management techniques. 
The project must contain a review of recently proposed cache management techniques and identify similarities and differences. 
The student should implement at least one cache management technique and compare its performance to a conventional LRU-managed cache.
Additional cache management techniques should be implemented and evaluated if time permits.
