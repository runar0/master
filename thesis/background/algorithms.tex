\label{sec:background:algorithms}

A cache partition algorithm divides a cache between the cores that share that cache.
Algorithms often enforce the division via policies that define how to insert new data and how and when old data is replaced.
Some algorithms are thread-aware and geared towards shared caches.
Others are thread-agnostic and work both for share and private caches.
Some have advanced optimization goals such as quality of service while others use simpler metrics like miss minimization.
In the following sections, we will present various algorithms primarily proposed to manage shared caches.
We will also present LRU, a caching algorithm that is thread-agnostic but still widely used both in private and shared caches in hardware today.

There exists a large number of works regarding cache partitioning. 
In this thesis, we select a few based on some characteristics and compare their performance.
Firstly we select only algorithms that attempt to reduce the number of cache misses.
This is a metric that is easy to measure and also makes it easy to compare the various algorithms.
We also focus on algorithms that target conventional caches as they are designed in CMPs today.
This again makes the results easy to compare across algorithms.
Also, we avoid having to extend our simulator with a new cache type, which would be a hard task given the time constraints of this thesis.

Each cache partition algorithm can be said to contain three different policies.
The replacement policy specifies which block the cache set evicts when a new block needs space in the set.
The insertion policy specifies the state of new blocks after insertion into  the cache set.
Finally, the promotion policy specifies what happens when a block in the cache set is accessed by a core.
In our description of the algorithms below we will use this division to explain the various parts of the algorithm.
