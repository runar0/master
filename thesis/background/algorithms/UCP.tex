\label{sec:background:algorithms:ucp}

The algorithm opens up for allocating zero columns to a core. 
As Sniper expects inclusive caches we have to add a requirement of atleast 1 column per core. 
The allocation algorithm will then start by setting all to 1 and then allocate the remanding m\_assoc-m\_cores ways.
