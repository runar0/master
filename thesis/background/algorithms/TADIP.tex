\label{sec:background:algorithms:tadip}

Explain the basic idea behind DIP, two algorithms and automatic selection. 
Refer to previous to section~\ref{sec:background:algorithms:lru} for a description of LRU (or aprox. LRU).

Describe BIP, angle it as LRU with a slightly modified insertion algorithm that only sometimes promotes on insert.

Describe set dueling and how the duel sets are distributed. We focus on TADIP-F.

Present some of the results from the original paper, refer to own experiments selecting the optimal BIP parameter, compare these to the original paper.
