\section{Sniper}
\label{sec:background:sniper}

\todo{Quickly introduce Sniper in terms of its features, interval simulation, trace-driven frontend. Separate simulation threads per simulated core, simulation speed improvement, but at the cost of accuracy}

\todo{Give a quick overview of clock skewing. Detail how this error source affects the simulation. Focus on the effects we observe in our results; cache access reordering and memory bus queue delay calculations. Mention the three ways of handling clock skewing implemented by Sniper, ignore, random-pair and barrier. Sniper paper has an evaluation of these schemes.}
