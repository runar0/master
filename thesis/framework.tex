\label{cpt:framework}

This chapter presents our selected simulator and shortly outlines the structure of the simulator's memory simulation.
We present the selection of algorithms we have implemented and show how they relate to each other and the simulator.
Finally, we provide details regarding any assumptions or changes that were necessary to implement working versions of the selected algorithms.
