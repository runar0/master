\label{sec:results:csmb_sensitivity}

\todo{We got a lot of data in this experiment, if there is a lot of variance we might give this section a lot of space, but if the results show little variance it could be kept short. }
\todo{Variance can be measured as the relative change in one or more of the metrics used in the base experiment.}
\todo{I picture a bar plot per algorithm with one group per workload group. Within each group three bars (1, 10 and 1000 cycles) showing precentwise difference compared to 100 cycles (default value). This will give 6 groups and 18 bars per graph. Some of these figures may be left out if they show little results.}
\todo{More detailed plots, ex. per workload group will be plotted, but only included if they show important data.}
