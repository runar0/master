\todo{This section will most likely grow as results are documented, and potential weaknesses are detected}

\todo{We need to document the problem with independent simulation threads. In the worst case, they execute sequentially and withing a single time quantum all core memory accesses may come sorted by core id, not time as in real life. This causes inaccuracies in the memory bus, which I documented last semester, but also potentially breaks most caching algorithms, especially those relying on access-recency. Our 3rd experiment show shed some light on the severity of this inaccuracy.}
