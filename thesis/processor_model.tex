\chapter{Processor Model}
\label{cpt:processor_model}

In this chapter, we will be presenting the processor model used in our experiments.
We begin by explaining the processor and shared memory system architecture and highlight some important properties.
Later in the chapter we show how we performed a sensitivity analysis in order to gain additional insight of our model.
