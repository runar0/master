\label{cpt:results}

This chapter contains descriptions of the four experiments performed as a part of this thesis.
Some experiments are intended to provide necessary data to fulfill the requirements of the assignment text while others are intended to explore error sources or the sensitivity of our setup towards important configuration properties.
Section~\ref{sec:results:model_sensitivity} starts by exploring how sensitive our simulation results are to changes in the core model configuration. 
Then section~\ref{sec:results:cache_partition} details our main experiment where we compare several cache partitioning algorithms against each other.
Next section~\ref{sec:results:l2size_sensitivity} covers an experiment where multiple L2 cache size configurations are used to explore how the various partition algorithms are affected by the size of the available private cache.
Finally section~\ref{sec:results:csmb_sensitivity} explores how simulation clock skew in Sniper affects the results of our main experiment.
