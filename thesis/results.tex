\chapter{Results}
\label{cpt:results}

In this chapter, we will outline four experiments and their results.
The first experiment, covered in section~\ref{sec:results:model_sensitivity}, will investigate the stability of our processor model and attempt to uncover  and remove any bottlenecks.
Section~\ref{sec:results:cache_partition} will cover the experiment where we evaluate the performance of the implemented cache partitioning algorithms.
Based on the previous experiment, section~\ref{sec:results:l2size_sensitivity} will cover an experiment where we vary the size of the private L2 cache in order to evaluate how this affects the partitioning algorithms.
Finally section~\ref{sec:results:csmb_sensitivity} explores how simulation clock skew in Sniper affects the results of our two previous experiments.
