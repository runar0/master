\chapter{Cache Partitioning Results}
\label{cpt:results}
In this chapter, we will outline an experiment where we compare the implemented cache partitioning algorithms against the commonly used LRU and each other.

\chapter{Sensitivity Analysis}
\label{cpt:sresults}
This chapter outlines a total of five experiments exploring the sensitivity of our simulated system and our cache partitioning results to various changes in the simulated architecture.
The first experiment, covered in section~\ref{sec:results:model_sensitivity}, will investigate the stability of our processor model and attempt to uncover and remove any bottlenecks.
Then section~\ref{sec:results:csmb_sensitivity} explores how simulation clock skew in Sniper affects the outcome of our experiments.
Sections~\ref{sec:results:l2size_sensitivity} and~\ref{sec:results:l3size_sensitivity} explore how algorithm performance is affected by the size of the L2 and L3 cache respectivly.
Finally section~\ref{sec:results:membus_sensitivity} explores how changing the bandwidth of the memory controller affects algorithm performance.
