\label{cpt:implementation}

\todo{One section per algorithm I've implemented. Explain any implementation detail not obvious from the original paper. All parameters should be reported. Where we have made changes these should be highlighted and backed up. Some changes have been made based on observations during testing, can they be backed up by a simple argument or do I need to run explicit experiments and show results backing up choices?}
