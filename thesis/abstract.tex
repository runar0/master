\section*{Abstract}

The performance gap between processors and main memory has been growing over the last decades.
Fast memory structures know as caches were introduced to mitigate some of the effects of this gap.
After processor producers reached the limits of single core processors performance in the early 2000-s, multicore processors have become common.
Multicore processors commonly share cache space between cores, and algorithms that manage access to shared cache structures have become an important research topic.
Many researchers have presented algorithms that are supposed to improve the performance of multicore processors by modifying cache policies.
In this thesis, we present and evaluate several recent and important works in the cache management field.
We present a simulation framework for evaluation of various cache management algorithms, based on the Sniper simulation system.
Several of the recently suggested algorithms are implemented and evaluated against the commonly used Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement policy.
Our results suggest that LRU replacement in many cases is sufficient, and few of the evaluated algorithms consistently outperforms LRU.
We also show that Utility Cache Partitioning, the oldest evaluated alternative to LRU, is the best performer for all our workloads.
