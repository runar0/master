\section{Sensitivity Analysis}

\todo{Introduce, specify why we chose the variables we do, and why we lock those we do.}

\subsection{ROB}
\todo{Begin by locking down outstanding loads and stores, set mshrs high and fine tune rob}

\subsection{MSHRs}
\paragraph{L1}
\todo{Lock ROB size to result from previous section, tune L1 MSHRs first data then instruction, just make sure L2 and L3 has as many MSHRs}


\paragraph{L2}
\todo{Start at sum of L1, attempt to lower and see how it effects the performance, if we can remove more than 5\% we probably want to}

\paragraph{L3}
\todo{This is harder, I assume that L2*Cores is max, but how far down can we go, and do we bother? unlike l1 and l2 we need to do multi core  experiments here ...}

\subsection{Outstanding Load/Store}
\todo{With ROB and MSHRs set we can confirm that changing this does not matter, we might just leave it}

\subsection{?}
\todo{Are there other variables we should check?}
