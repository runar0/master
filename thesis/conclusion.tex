\section{Conclusion}

\todo{We have curated a list of recent and important cache partitining algorithms}

\todo{A simulator framework based on Sniper was implemented, and so was several of the algorithms}
\todo{We are aware of the error sources in sniper, but conculde that they are reasonable}


\begin{figure}[ht]
	\todo{Two options; 4-core random workload averages or average all random workoad averages.}
	\caption{Average algorithm performance measured in STP relative to LRU by year of publication.}
\end{figure}

\todo{UCP is dominating in all categories}
\todo{Refere to figure, are we moving forward?}


\section{Future Work}
\todo{More algorithms should be gathered, and even more should be implemented}

\todo{A comparison of our results against a cycle-accurate simulator may be usefull}
