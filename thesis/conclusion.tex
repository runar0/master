\todo{We have curated a list of recent and important cache partitioning algorithms}

\todo{A simulator framework based on Sniper was implemented, and so was several of the algorithms}
\todo{We are aware of the error sources in sniper but conclude that they are reasonable}

\todo{UCP is dominating in all categories}
\todo{Refer to figure, in our 4-core workloads UCP seems to have been a highpoint? We should mention that some of the newer algorithms are cheaper than UCP, so there is a trade-off to be made}


\section{Future Work}
\todo{More algorithms should be gathered, and even more should be implemented}

\todo{A comparison of our results against a cycle-accurate simulator may be usefull}
