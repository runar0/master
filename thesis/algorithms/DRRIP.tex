Dynamic Re-Reference Interval Prediction (DRRIP)~\cite{Jaleel2010} was proposed in 2010.
DRRIP does not utilize the concept of an LRU stack as done by LRU and TADIP.
In DRRIP, each cache block has a number associated with it, called re-reference interval.
The re-reference interval is a relative measure of when the algorithm expects a block to be re-referenced.
Given two blocks with different re-reference intervals, then the block with a lower interval is expected to be re-referenced before the other block.
A value between 0 and $2^M - 1$ is used to represent the re-reference interval.
M is a configurable variable usually in the interval $[2, 5]$~\cite{Jaleel2010}.
The value of 0 indicates a \textit{near} re-reference interval, the algorithm expects the block to be re-referenced in the near future.
The value $2^M - 1$ indicates a \textit{distant} re-reference interval while the value of $2^M - 2$ indicates a \textit{long} re-reference interval.
Multiple blocks may have the same re-reference interval. 
Hence, blocks are not strictly ordered as in the LRU stack.
By setting $M=1$, DRRIP degrades into the Not Recently Used (NRU)~\cite{Microsystems2007} algorithm, which among others is used on the UltraSPARC T2.

The replacement policy of DRRIP is to scan all blocks and evict the first one found with a distant re-reference interval.
If no blocks have a distant re-reference interval the re-reference interval of all blocks is incremented by one and the scan restarts.
This process repeats until the algorithm finds a victim block.
If multiple blocks are potential victims, the algorithm uses the scan order as a tie-breaker.
In the original paper, the authors specify that the leftmost potential block, the one with a lower block index, is the victim in the case of a tie.

DRRIP's promotion policy is to decrement the re-reference interval of the accessed block.
By doing this DRRIP utilize access history rather than access time when calculating the re-reference interval.
Hence, to reach a near re-reference interval a block has to be accessed multiple times.
This promotion policy is different compared to LRU and TADIP, where a block will move to the MRU position following a hit, independent of the previous access history.

The insertion policy of DRRIP, like DIP and TADIP, is composed of two different policies and a selection mechanism.
Static RRIP (SRRIP) will always insert new blocks with a long re-reference interval. 
Depending on the state of the cache, there might be existing blocks with a higher re-reference interval than the blocks inserted by SRRIP.
This gives the newly inserted blocks a chance to see a re-reference before being replaced.
Binominal RRIP (BRRIP) is analog to BIP in DIP.
BRRIP with either insert new blocks with a distant re-reference interval or, with a small probability, insert like SRRIP with a long re-reference interval.
Like BIP, BRRIP will allow trashing access patterns to keep some of the working set in the cache and hence improve performance over SRRIP.
Selecting between the two insertion policies can be done using set dueling or ATDs, similar to what was described for TADIP.
The authors use set-dueling in their original paper, and we opt to do this in our implementation as well.

Figure~\ref{fig:algorithms:drrip_example} shows an example cache managed by DRRIP.
In the example, M is set to 2, making the distant re-reference interval 3 and the long re-reference interval 2. 
Also, we assume static insertion throughout the example.
Initially, there are four blocks A, B, C and D with re-reference intervals 2, 1, 1 and 0.
First an access hits the C block, and its value decrements to 0.
Next a miss to block E occurs, and as no block has a re-reference interval of 3 the value of all blocks is incremented by one. 
A then has a value of 3 and is evicted, E is inserted in its place with a value of 2.
Finally, a hit to E occurs causing its value to decrease.
