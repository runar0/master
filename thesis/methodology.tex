\section{Base Experiment}
\todo{Describe base experiment with locked L2 size, L3 depending on workload size. All workloads executed. Define speedup, define STP with the same reference as in the previous semester. Define HMS. Quickly explain why we need both STP and HMS, what differences may they show? Also mention that we capture number of misses (and miss rate). Explain when we dump statistics for each benchmark}

\section{L2 Sensitivity}
\todo{Explain how we repeat the base experiment above with varying L2 size, but all other parameters locked. Explain how results of these experiments are compared the base experiment.}

\section{Simulator Parallelism Sentitivity}
\todo{Explain how we repeat the base experiment but this time keep the parallelism in the simulator locked. Results from this experiment will most likely be compared to the base experiment as in the l2 experiment}
