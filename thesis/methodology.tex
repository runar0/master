\label{cpt:methodology}

In this chapter, we introduce the processor model used in our experiments.
We also introduce our benchmarks, and how we built workloads of various sizes based on these benchmarks.
Finally, we introduce the various performance metrics used to evaluate the implemented cache partitioning algorithms.
