\label{cpt:methodology}

This chapter introduces the processor model used in our experiments.
The benchmarks used and how we built workloads of difference sizes from our benchmark pool is covered.
Finally, we introduce the various performance metrics we will use to evaluate the implemented cache partitioning algorithms.
