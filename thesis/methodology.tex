\chapter{Methodology}
\label{cpt:methodology}

This chapter introduces the simulator and benchmarks we will utilize in our work.
It describes the simulated processor architecture and outlines how we use sample extraction to reduce simulation time.
Finally, we introduce the various performance metrics we will use to evaluate the implemented cache partitioning algorithms.
